# Save Aiyaman in 20s
This is just a simple game project to try out the [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk)
engine that was given out free for [20s Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam) joiners. You have 20 seconds
to interact with the objects and save Aiyaman from death.

### Thoughts on DragonRuby GTK
I took this game jam as an opportunity to try out something new for game development, and I must say that I am highly
impressed by the elegance of DragonRuby. It provides excellent control over what you want to output to the player,
with plenty of built-in functions that are actually much more lean and specific compared to any other game engine I've
come across so far. It is tiny, efficient, builds to various platforms and provides a in-game console right out of
the box.

It is very powerful in the hands of a computer scientist and a software engineer, though not so
much an artist or a game developer. Programming with DragonRuby requires a more functional and mathematical approach
as compared to the more intuitive GUI workflows of other game engines like Unity. This is not a bad thing; it fills
a niche in game development methodology, and is very refreshing to see. You have a lot of control just by code alone,
all this power at your fingertips with zero bloat.

It is unfortunate that it is behind a paywall which makes it difficult for it to be popular compared to more rounded,
open-source and feature-packed game engines like Godot. Not only that, its documentation is quite poor.
As of 29th November 2022, methods like `Numeric#randomize` and `args.audio.delete` were used and dumped in various code
snippets, but not actually explained. While I don't mind reading through code, they need to belong in the
right sections in the table of contents for users to be able to look it up.

Overall, I find DragonRuby powerful and fun to use. However, its pricing makes it very difficult for me to recommend.
If you could get this for free in a game jam like I did, it is definitely worth your time.
