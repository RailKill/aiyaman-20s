# Save Aiyaman in 20s
This is just a simple game project to try out the [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk)
engine that was given out free for [20s Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam) joiners. You have 20 seconds
to interact with the objects and save Aiyaman from death.
